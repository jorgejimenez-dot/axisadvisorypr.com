    <h1>What Is a Business Valuation?</h1>

  <section class="article-body"><div class="article-inner">

    <p>Every business owner has a number in their head — a rough sense of what their company is worth. Maybe it comes from what a competitor sold for, a conversation with a broker, or simply years of gut feeling built on the job.</p>
    <p>The problem is that gut feeling, however informed, is not a defensible number. And when the stakes are real — a buy-sell trigger, a partner exit, a generational transition, an unexpected offer — the gap between intuition and a professionally supported value can be significant.</p>
    <p>A business valuation closes that gap. It is a formal, standards-based analysis performed by a credentialed analyst using recognized methodologies. It produces a documented, defensible result — not a guess, not a broker's listing price, and not a rule of thumb.</p>

    <h2>What a Business Valuation Actually Is</h2>
    <p>At its core, a business valuation is a professional estimate of the economic value of a business or an ownership interest in a business. It captures earning power, market position, risk profile, and intangible value — not just physical assets or last year's revenue.</p>
    <p>A credentialed valuation is governed by professional standards (NACVA Professional Standards, AICPA SSVS-1, USPAP) that define how the analysis must be conducted, documented, and reported. This is what separates it from informal estimates: every assumption is documented, every method is justified, and the conclusion can withstand professional scrutiny.</p>

    <h2>When Would I Need One?</h2>
    <p>The short answer: more often than most owners think. Common situations include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Selling or buying a business</strong> — establishing fair market value before negotiations begin</li>
      <li><strong>Bringing in or buying out a partner</strong> — ensuring equitable terms for all parties</li>
      <li><strong>Succession planning and generational transitions</strong> — the foundation of any credible exit plan</li>
      <li><strong>Buy-sell agreement compliance</strong> — most agreements reference fair market value but lack a current determination</li>
      <li><strong>Estate and gift tax planning</strong> — IRS scrutiny demands defensible supporting documentation</li>
      <li><strong>Divorce proceedings involving business interests</strong> — courts require independent, standards-compliant analysis</li>
      <li><strong>Strategic decision-making</strong> — expansion timing, capital allocation, exit readiness</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="callout"><p>The worst time to get a valuation is when you urgently need one. Planning ahead gives you options and time to prepare.</p></div>

    <h2>How Does the Process Work?</h2>
    <p>A typical engagement follows a clear, structured path:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Initial conversation</strong> to define purpose, scope, and the appropriate level of analysis</li>
      <li><strong>Data collection</strong> — we provide a focused request list covering tax returns, financial statements, and key operating details</li>
      <li><strong>Analysis</strong> using multiple valuation methods selected based on the facts and circumstances of the business</li>
      <li><strong>Report delivery</strong> with a clear conclusion of value, documented methodology, and stated assumptions</li>
      <li><strong>Analyst walkthrough</strong> so you understand the result and can use it with confidence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For a CalcReport engagement, the typical timeline is 2–3 weeks from receipt of complete data. Fees are quoted upfront as a fixed amount — no hourly billing, no scope creep.</p>

    <h2>What Drives the Value of a Small Business?</h2>
    <p>Several factors influence what a closely-held business is worth. An analyst evaluates all of them in context:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Earnings consistency and growth trajectory</strong> — the most fundamental driver of value for income-producing businesses</li>
      <li><strong>Customer concentration and diversification</strong> — heavy reliance on a few customers increases risk</li>
      <li><strong>Owner dependence vs. management depth</strong> — a business that cannot run without the owner is worth less than one that can</li>
      <li><strong>Industry trends and competitive position</strong> — where the business sits relative to its market</li>
      <li><strong>Quality of financial records</strong> — clean, organized books reduce risk and support a stronger valuation</li>
      <li><strong>Tangible and intangible assets</strong> — equipment, real estate, intellectual property, customer relationships, brand equity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In Puerto Rico specifically, local market conditions, tax incentive structures (including Act 60), and the regulatory environment all influence value. A valuation that ignores these factors will miss the full picture.</p>

    <h2>CalcReport vs. Comprehensive Valuation</h2>
    <p>Not every situation requires a comprehensive valuation. A <a href="article-calcreport-vs-full.html" class="inline-link">CalcReport (calculation of value)</a> is a focused, standards-compliant engagement that delivers a defensible indication of value at a lower cost and faster timeline. For most planning, transactional, and internal purposes, it's sufficient.</p>
    <p>When the situation involves high-stakes transactions, complex structures, or circumstances requiring a formal opinion of value, a comprehensive valuation — producing a formal conclusion of value — may be more appropriate. We help every client determine the right scope before any engagement begins.</p>
