    <p>The most common question we hear: "Do I need a full valuation, or is there a simpler option?" The answer depends on the purpose and intended use of the analysis. Here is a straightforward framework for making that decision.</p>

    <h2>Calculation of Value (CalcReport)</h2>
    <p>A CalcReport is a focused analysis using agreed-upon approaches and assumptions. It produces an <strong>indication of value</strong> — defensible and standards-compliant, but narrower in scope than a comprehensive valuation engagement. Key characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Does not require the analyst to consider all possible approaches — only those agreed upon as appropriate</li>
      <li>Lower cost and faster turnaround (2–3 weeks typical)</li>
      <li>Produces a professional report with documented methodology and assumptions</li>
      <li>Appropriate for most planning, transactional, and internal purposes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The word "calculation" refers to scope, not quality. A CalcReport applies the same analytical rigor, the same professional standards, and the same credentialed expertise as any other valuation engagement. The difference is the breadth of analysis required.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion of Value (Comprehensive Valuation)</h2>
    <p>A comprehensive valuation considers all three valuation approaches — income, market, and asset-based. It produces a formal <strong>conclusion of value</strong> with complete documentation. Key characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Requires evaluating and documenting all relevant approach and method decisions</li>
      <li>Higher cost and longer timeline (4–6 weeks typical)</li>
      <li>Produces a detailed narrative report suitable for external scrutiny</li>
      <li>Required when the analysis will face regulatory, legal, or institutional review</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Decision Guide</h2>

    <h2>What AXIS Offers</h2>
    <p>AXIS Independent Advisory specializes in CalcReport engagements — the practical, cost-effective scope that serves the majority of closely-held business valuation needs in Puerto Rico. If your situation requires a comprehensive valuation (a formal conclusion of value), we can refer you to a qualified practitioner with broader scope capability. In either case, the initial consultation will help clarify which level of analysis fits your situation.</p>

    <h2>Already Have a CalcReport? Keep It Current.</h2>
    <p>If you've completed a CalcReport with AXIS, an <strong>Annual Update</strong> refreshes your prior analysis with current-year financials at a reduced fee ($750–$1,250) and faster turnaround (1–2 weeks). Ideal for buy-sell agreements that require annual fair market value determinations. See <a href="services.html#annual-update">Annual Update</a> for details.</p>

    <h2>What About Broker Opinions and Informal Estimates?</h2>
    <p>A CalcReport is <strong>not</strong> a broker's opinion of value (BOV), which is a marketing tool used to list businesses for sale. It is not a rough estimate or a rule-of-thumb calculation. A CalcReport is a professional engagement governed by national standards, performed by a credentialed analyst, with documented methodology and defensible conclusions.</p>
